# Getting Started Guide

This document explains demo and how to run them.

## Summary of demos

If demo does not work properly, please refer to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

The following table indicates the character of demos.
|Demo Name|Based AWS IoT contents|Description|
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|PubSub|[coreMQTT demos](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/mqtt-demo.html)|It demonstrates simple MQTT communication between device and AWS server.|
|Fleet Provisioning|[AWS IoT fleet provisioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/provision-wo-cert.html)|It provides the some secure provisioning operation to device at first connection to AWS server.|
|OTA| [OTA tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/dev-guide-ota-workflow.html) | It provides the steps to update the firmware on your device.|

Each demo is independent as a FreeRTOS's task. It means multiple demos can be run at the same time.

The demos connect to AWS IoT core via the Ethernet, Cellular, or Wi-Fi with MQTT protocol by using the [CoreMQTT-Agent](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreMQTT-Agent) library to share a single MQTT connection among multiple tasks.These tasks establish a server and client-authenticated TLS connection, and demonstrates the subscribe-publish workflow of MQTT.

It is also possible to demonstrate MQTT connection using TLS communication with TSIP.

## How to run demos

This chapter explains step by step instructions for running demos by importing projects into e2 studio.  
When you create as a new projects according to the FAQ below, you can skip step1 and step3.

##### Step 4-1-1: Software setup for PubSub demo

Configure settings to run PubSub demo.

###### Configure combination of demos for PubSub demo

Configure settings to select combination of demos.
In "Projects\\<project_name>\\e2 studio_ccrx\\src\\frtos_config\\demo_config.h", configure both of `ENABLE_FLEET_PROVISIONING_DEMO` and `ENABLE_OTA_UPDATE_DEMO`, which allow to select the different supported demo combinations:

* `ENABLE_FLEET_PROVISIONING_DEMO`: (0)
* `ENABLE_OTA_UPDATE_DEMO`: (0)  
![4-1-1](https://github.com/renesas/iot-reference-rx/wiki/getting_started_guide_image/step4_1_1config.PNG?raw=true)

###### Settings of the hook function (Only using Cellular or Wi-Fi)

The socket wrapper layer provides a hook function to reset the cellular or wi-fi module when an error occurs.
It is recommended to reset the module if the FIT module API "R_Cellular_xxx"/"R_WIFI_xxx" returns errors `CELLULAR_ERR_MODULE_TIMEOUT`, `CELLULAR_ERR_MODULE_COM` in case of Cellular or `WIFI_ERR_MODULE_COM` in case of Wi-Fi. Otherwise, the module may not communicate.
You can change `USER_TCP_HOOK_ENABLED` in "Projects\\<project_name>\\e2 studio_ccrx\\src\\frtos_config\\user_tcp_hook_config.h" to enable or disable this hook.

You can use hook as-is if you only run the demos.
In our current implementation, cellular or wi-fi module is reset in this hook when the following conditions:

* On TCP_Sockets_Connect,
  * When both errors occur 1 time.
* On TCP_Sockets_Recv and TCP_Sockets_Send,
  * In case of Cellular:
    * When `CELLULAR_ERR_MODULE_TIMEOUT` occurs 1 time.
    * When `CELLULAR_ERR_MODULE_COM` occurs continuously 3 times.
      * You can change retry numbers by configuring `USER_COMM_ERROR_TRIES`.
  * In case of Wi-Fi:
    * When `WIFI_ERR_MODULE_COM` occurs 1 time.

###### Settings of RX Smart Configurator

Configure the Renesas code generator (RX Smart Configurator*).

##### Step 4-1-7: Input via CLI for PubSub demo

CLI runs on the serial terminal application when starting demo.
Input the following commands to the serial terminal application to start communication to AWS.

The summarized flow of the command input is as follows:

1. Switch CLI mode.
1. Set IoT information (thing name and MQTT endpoint).
1. Set security information (device certificate and private key).
1. Commit preceding changes.
1. Reset and restart demo.

###### Switch to CLI mode

CLI automatically runs just after starting demo.
First, Switch to CLI mode by inputting the following command:
```text
> CLI
Going to FreeRTOS-CLI !
```
 ![4-1-6](https://github.com/renesas/iot-reference-rx/wiki/getting_started_guide_image/step4_1_6_1.PNG?raw=true) 

**Note:** CLI will timeout after some seconds. If timeout occurs, core process of demo runs.

###### Set IoT information

Next, format the Data Flash:

```text
> format
Format OK !
```

 ![4-1-6](https://github.com/renesas/iot-reference-rx/wiki/getting_started_guide_image/step4_1_6_2.PNG?raw=true) 

Next, configure the desired thing name / mqtt device identifier:

#### Step 4-2: Run PubSub/MQTT with Fleet Provisioning sample project

Details for *PubSub/MQTT with Fleet Provisioning sample project* are provided in the special application note (document number: R20AN0674). You can search it by visiting the following webpage:  
In this chapter, the "PubSub/MQTT with Fleet Provisioning sample project" will be referred to as the "PubSub demo with Fleet Provisioning".

* <https://www.renesas.com/search?keywords=r20an0674>

About how to run this demo, see the chapter *4. Running the Fleet Provisioning Demo* in preceding application note. Or watching the following video:

* <https://www.renesas.com/us/en/video/amazon-freertos-fleet-provisioning-tutorial-ck-rx65n-12-iot-devices-cloud-operation>

Though this application note is for both Ethernet and Cellular projects, Wi-Fi project will also work as described in application note.

When running this demo, please enable [**Settings of RX Smart Configurator**](#settings-of-rx-smart-configurator) before generating code with RX Smart Configurator.  
Also, if there is a gray icon in the component tree of Smart Configurator, the corresponding component does not exist in your environment.  
Refer to the "[**Download the FreeRTOS kernel, FreeRTOS LittleFS and FIT module**](#download-the-freertos-kernel-freertos-littlefs-and-fit-module)" section to download the modules you need.

##### Precaution for PubSub demo with Fleet Provisioning

* Make sure to follow the steps described in the preceding application note.
* If you deviate from the *normal flow*, the Data Flash usage is not guaranteed.
* The following is an example of Fleet Provisioning with *abnormal flow*:
  1. When demo program enters CLI mode first time,
     set and commit claim credentials, endpoint, template and rootCA information as usual.
  1. After Fleet Provisioning and PubSub demo completes, reset the device.
  1. When demo program enters CLI mode again after reset,
      set and commit a new set of device credentials.
* With the *normal flow*, Data Flash usage is ~7808 bytes after Fleet Provisioning.
* With the *abnormal flow*, new device credentials will overwrite existing credentials provisioned by Fleet Provisioning.
  * In this case, an additional 1408 bytes will be used.
* Currently the maximum response latency between AWS and the device is set at 5000 ms.  
The latency is set to be long enough to allow for a margin of error.  
If you want to shorten the latency, please adjust it according to your environment.

## Troubleshooting

### Improve tranfer speed for OTA Update

* `mqttexampleTRANSPORT_SEND_RECV_TIMEOUT_MS` can be set to 150 or higher  to improve OTA execution time.
* Set the default value to 150 or higher after setting the sending and receiving timeout values separately for sending and receiving.

### Improve timeout when connection error happens

If an error occurs during cellular or wi-fi communication due to the communication environment, changing each definition to the following "correction value" may improve the problem. 

|Definition Name|Description|defalt value|correction value|path|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|mqttexampleTRANSPORT_SEND_RECV_TIMEOUT_MS| Timeout in milliseconds to send and receive in the transport layer. You try to change the value to more bigger when you met TLS handshake error. Changes in this value affect the time of MQTT communication. A change in the MQTT communication time may increase or decrease the OTA process time. So you should adjust the value of time according to your communication environment. |450|`750`|Demos\mqtt_agent\mqtt_agent_task.c|
|MQTT_AGENT_MAX_EVENT_QUEUE_WAIT_TIME|Time in milliseconds that the MQTT agent task will wait in the Blocked state (so not using any CPU time) for a command to arrive in its command queue before exiting the blocked state so it can call MQTT_ProcessLoop().|50U|`1000U`|src\frtos_config\core_mqtt_agent_config.h|

However, each definition affects the execution time of the demo.  
If the above values are set, the execution time of the demo may increase.  

### How to change MAC Address

The MAC address used in the sample project can be changed using the Smart Configurator.  
The MAC address assigned to your board can be found on a sticker on the board's Ethernet connector.  
If the sticker is not attached, please check [Tool News](https://www.renesas.com/document/tnn/notification-information-about-ck-rx65n-mac-address?r=1611756).  
![TroubleShooting_0_1_MAC_Address_Board](https://github.com/renesas/iot-reference-rx/wiki/getting_started_guide_image/TroubleShooting_0_1_MAC_Address_Board.png)  
MAC Address can be changed from FreeRTOS Kernel of the Smart Configurator.  
Change Components-> FreeRTOS Kernel-> MAC address X (X = 0 to 5).  
After changing the settings, be sure to **Generate Code** and **Build**.
